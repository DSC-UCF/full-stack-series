# Session 2 - React and JS
In this session, we'll be continuing our web app UI, this time in React. React is a JS library for building UIs.

If you've never used JS before, it's highly reccomended that you take a look into it before diving into react. You can look at JS documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) Also, the NetNinja has a great intro YouTube course [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9haFPT7J25Q9GRB_ZkFrQAc)

To get started with this repo, you'll need node.js installed, which comes with npm (node package manager). Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download it for your OS.
